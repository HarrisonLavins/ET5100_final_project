# ET5100 Final Project
A final project mechatronics project in fulfillment of the requirements for ET 5100 Fundamentals of Mechatronics and Industrial Applications at Wayne State University for Fall 2023.

## Summary
A teleoperated mechanum-wheeled robot which demonstrates an automatic emergency braking (AEB) collision mitigation system using ultrasonic sensors.

## System Requirements
- The system shall allow an operator to wirelessly teleoperate the vehicle indoors from a distance of no less than 10m.
- The system shall be able to operate on battery power alone for a period of no less than 30 minutes.
- The system shall have a top forward drive speed of no less than 0.5 m/s.
- The system shall be able to pivot turn 180 degrees.
- The system shall be able to travel directly sideways to the left and right.
- The system shall be able to detect when a frontal collision is imminant and engage an automatic emergency braking (AEB) collision mitigation action.
